# Demo of a technique for adding private dependencies without allowing
# them to override compiled public dependencies.
#
# To build:
#
#     pip-compile -o internal.txt internal.in
#
# To use:
#
#     pip-sync internal.txt requirements/edx/base.txt
#
# (internal.in and internal.txt would be created and managed by the
# deployment process)

# Ensures that internal dependencies don't conflict with the lockfile

-c requirements/edx/base.txt

# Specs for internal-only or private dependencies
