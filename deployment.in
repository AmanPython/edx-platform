# Demo of a technique for adding private dependencies without allowing
# them to override compiled public dependencies.
#
# To build:
#
#     rm deployment.txt
#     pip-compile -o deployment.txt deployment.in

-r requirements/edx/base.txt
-c requirements/edx/base.txt # Constrain to these exact versions, too
-r internal.in
